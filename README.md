# Advanced House Price Prediction üè°

## 1. Project Overview

This project presents a complete data science workflow to accurately predict residential house prices in King County, USA. The primary objective is to develop a high-performance regression model by leveraging advanced feature engineering and the LightGBM algorithm. The final model successfully explains approximately 88% of the variance in house prices, providing valuable insights into the key drivers of the real estate market.
